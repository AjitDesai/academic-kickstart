abstract: "Aeroelastic stability remains an important concern for the design of modern structures
 such as wind turbine rotors, more so with the use of increasingly flexible blades.
 A nonlinear aeroelastic system has been considered in the present study with parametric
 uncertainties. Uncertainties can occur due to any inherent randomness in
 the system or modeling limitations, and so forth. Uncertainties can play a significant role in
 the aeroelastic stability predictions in a nonlinear system. The analysis has been
 put in a stochastic framework, and the propagation of system uncertainties has
 been quantified in the aeroelastic response. A spectral uncertainty quantification
 tool called Polynomial Chaos Expansion has been used. A projection-based nonintrusive
 Polynomial Chaos approach is shown to be much faster than its classical
 Galerkin method based counterpart. Traditional Monte Carlo Simulation is used
 as a reference solution. Effect of system randomness on the bifurcation behavior
 and the flutter boundary has been presented. Stochastic bifurcation results and
 bifurcation of probability density functions are also discussed."
