abstract: "This paper utilizes deep reinforcement learning to approximate the policy rules of banks participating in a high-value payments system. The objective of the agents is to learn (a) the optimal intraday payments decisions; and (b) the optimal initial liquidity choices. In a simplified two-agent setting, the agents learn the optimal intraday payments policy when unrestricted collateral is provided. For the initial liquidity choice problem, when using the optimal intraday payments policy, the agents learn to choose the initial liquidity that minimizes the cost of processing all payments. Our results show the applicability of DRL to estimate best-response functions in real-world strategic games."
