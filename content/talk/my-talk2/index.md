summary: This paper utilizes deep reinforcement learning to approximate the policy rules of banks participating in a high-value payments system. In a simplified two-agent setting, the agents learn the optimal intraday payments policy and optimal initial liquidity choice policy. Our results show the applicability of DRL to estimate best-response functions in real-world strategic games.
